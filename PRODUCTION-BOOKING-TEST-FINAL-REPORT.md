# Skin Societe Production Booking System Test - Final Report

## Executive Summary

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Test Target:** https://skinsocieteapp.onrender.com/appointments  
**Test Focus:** Cottesloe staff filtering fix verification  
**Overall Status:** ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**  

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**Staff filtering is NOT working in production.** The availability API is returning **12 staff members** instead of the expected **2 staff members** (Isabelle and Mel) for the Cottesloe branch.

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **Page Accessibility:** Booking page loads correctly at production URL
- **UI Components:** All booking interface elements are present and styled
- **API Connectivity:** Availability API responds successfully (HTTP 200)
- **Service Selection:** Mode selectors (By Concern, Gallery, List) are functional
- **Basic Navigation:** Page structure and navigation work properly

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Staff Filtering Completely Broken
- **Expected:** 2 staff (Isabelle Callaghan, Melissa Tincey)
- **Actual:** 12 staff returned by API
- **Impact:** Users see all staff instead of location-specific staff
- **Severity:** HIGH - Core functionality not working

#### 2. Injectable Service Qualification Filtering Not Working  
- **Expected:** Only nurse-qualified staff (Isabelle) for Dermal Filler
- **Actual:** All 12 staff available for injectable services
- **Impact:** Non-qualified staff can be booked for procedures requiring nursing qualifications
- **Severity:** HIGH - Safety/qualification concern

#### 3. Authentication Required for Full Testing
- **Issue:** Complete booking flow cannot be tested without user authentication
- **Impact:** Cannot verify booking completion or "Booking details are invalid" errors
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Testing limitation

## Detailed Test Results

### API Testing Results

**Availability API Test (`/api/appointments/availability`)**
```
POST /api/appointments/availability
Request: {
  "date": "2025-08-08",
  "serviceId": "gyyUxf51abS0lB-A_3PDFA", // Dermal Filler
  "branchId": "wQbnBjP6ztI8nuVpNT6MsQ", // Cottesloe
  "duration": 60
}

Response: HTTP 200
{
  "success": true,
  "slotsFound": 204,
  "staffFound": 12,  // ‚ùå SHOULD BE 2
  "staff": [
    "Adarsh Das",
    "Chris Mihaljevich", 
    "Isabelle Callaghan", // ‚úÖ Expected
    "Jannine Simone",

    "Phorest Test",
    "Tim Hardy"
  ]
}
```

### Browser Testing Results

**Page Load and UI Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Page loads in 1-2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Proper branding and styling displayed
- ‚úÖ Booking interface skeleton loads correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Services show as loading skeletons (requires authentication)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sign In required for full functionality

**Screenshots Captured:**
- Initial page load with booking interface
- Mode selector functionality
- Loading states and service placeholders

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the test results, the staff filtering implementation has the following issues:

### 1. Branch-Based Filtering Not Applied
The API is not filtering staff by the `branchId` parameter. All staff across all branches are being returned regardless of the specified Cottesloe branch ID (`wQbnBjP6ztI8nuVpNT6MsQ`).

### 2. Service Qualification Filtering Missing
Injectable services (Dermal Filler) should only show nurse-qualified staff, but all staff are available regardless of qualifications.

### 3. Implementation Not Deployed
Either the staff filtering code was not properly deployed to production, or the filtering logic is being bypassed by the current API implementation.

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Cottesloe Staff Filtering
**Expected Behavior:**
- Only 2 staff should appear for Cottesloe appointments
- Isabelle Callaghan (Nurse) - available for all services including injectables
- Melissa Tincey (Mel) - available for facial and non-injectable services

**Actual Behavior:**
- 12 staff appear from across all locations/branches
- No location-based filtering applied

### Injectable Service Filtering
**Expected Behavior:**
- Dermal Filler services should only show Isabelle (nurse-qualified)
- Other staff should be filtered out for qualification requirements

**Actual Behavior:**
- All 12 staff available for injectable services
- No qualification-based filtering applied

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Fix Staff Filtering in Production
1. **Verify API Implementation:** Check if `/api/appointments/availability` properly implements branch and qualification filtering
2. **Review Deployment:** Ensure staff filtering code changes were properly deployed to production
3. **Database Verification:** Confirm staff records have correct branch and qualification associations

### Priority 2: Implement Comprehensive Testing
1. **API Integration Tests:** Create automated tests for availability API with various scenarios
2. **Staff Filtering Tests:** Specific tests for branch and qualification filtering
3. **End-to-End Monitoring:** Set up production monitoring for booking system health

### Priority 3: User Experience Improvements
1. **Authentication Flow:** Streamline testing with test user accounts
2. **Loading States:** Improve service loading UX with better feedback
3. **Error Handling:** Monitor and address "Booking details are invalid" errors

## Test Artifacts

**Screenshots Generated:**
- `screenshot-1-booking-page-loaded-*.png` - Initial page state
- `analysis-after-analysis-*.png` - Full page analysis
- `auth-test-*.png` - Authentication flow testing

**Reports Generated:**
- `api-test-report-*.json` - Detailed API testing results
- `booking-verification-report-*.json` - Comprehensive verification analysis
- `auth-test-report-*.json` - Authentication testing results

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Emergency Fix:** Review and redeploy staff filtering logic to production API
2. **Verification:** Re-run API tests to confirm filtering is working
3. **Hotfix Testing:** Test with actual booking attempts once filtering is fixed

### Short Term (This Week)  
1. **Automated Testing:** Implement continuous API testing for staff filtering
2. **Production Monitoring:** Set up alerts for staff filtering failures
3. **User Acceptance Testing:** Complete end-to-end booking workflow testing

### Long Term (Ongoing)
1. **Testing Infrastructure:** Build comprehensive E2E testing with authentication
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor booking system performance and success rates
3. **User Experience:** Improve authentication flow and loading states

## Conclusion

The production booking system test has identified a **critical failure** in the staff filtering implementation. While the basic booking interface and API connectivity work correctly, the core functionality for limiting staff to location-specific team members is completely non-functional.

**The Cottesloe staff filtering fix that was reported as implemented is NOT working in production.**

This requires immediate attention as it affects both user experience (showing too many irrelevant staff options) and potentially safety/compliance (allowing bookings with non-qualified staff for specialized procedures).

1. Fix staff filtering in production API immediately
2. Re-run verification tests
3. Implement ongoing monitoring to prevent regression
